# Files Pwg
Place this app in **owncloud/apps/** and make sure directory name is files_pwg

##Usage

I made this plugin to simplify the task of making a symlink of a picture directory in owncloud/nextcloud inside the piwigo gallery directory. After that, I just have to click "synchronize" on piwigo, and I have made a web gallerie from the selected directory of my owncloud repo.
Of course, owncloud server and piwigo server have to be on the same computer.
